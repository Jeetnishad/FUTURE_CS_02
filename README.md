## 🔐 PHISHING SIMULATION – TASK 2

This repository contains my submission for Task 2 of the cybersecurity internship, focused on executing a controlled phishing simulation. The objective was to design and deploy a realistic phishing attack, measure user responses, and draw insights for future security training.

# 📁 PROJECT STRUCTURE
# 📂 Phishing_Data/
Includes:

Detailed campaign logs

Video recordings showing email interaction and login page activity

# 📂 Final_Report/
Includes:

📄 Final_Report.docx – A comprehensive analysis of the phishing campaign strategy, outcomes, and recommendations for user awareness training

🛠️ TOOLS & RESOURCES USED
Gophish – Used to manage the email phishing campaign and track engagement

Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) – For crafting believable phishing.

Custom Gmail Clone Page – Built to simulate a credential-harvesting scenario

# 📌 SIMULATION OVERVIEW
📨 Scenario:
A phishing email pretending to be from a security monitoring service alerted users of unusual activity and instructed them to verify their account by logging in via a provided link.

Spoofed Email ID: alerts.cybersecunit2025@gmail.com

📎 Link Behavior: Redirected users to a cloned Gmail login page designed to mimic the real interface closely.

# 📢 Final Message After Login Attempt:

"Warning: This is part of a phishing test. Never trust suspicious login links!"

# 📊 RESULTS & INSIGHTS
Phishing Emails Sent: 8 (to Gmail accounts I created)

Successful Logins Captured: 3

Engagement Rate: 37.5%

# 📌 Observation:
Even in a controlled test, nearly 40% of accounts submitted their login data, indicating high effectiveness of well-crafted phishing attempts and highlighting the need for ongoing awareness training.

# 🧠 SKILLS DEVELOPED
Practical understanding of social engineering

Crafting and delivering phishing emails

Cloning login pages for educational simulation

Analyzing user behavior under phishing conditions

Building recommendations for security education
